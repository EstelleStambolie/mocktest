## This is my mocktest assignment

I first try to make a function to load data and apply it below
```{r}
Happy_data<-Data_Collating("Data/Happy")
```

Here I create a texevier template to use in my directory
```{r}
Texevier::create_template("mocktest/Settings")
```
I can now copy paste, and edit this as I desire

For my narrative assignment I create graphs with the following code
```{r}

```
